/** Doubly linked lists of generic (void *) values */

/**
 * We define a struct list type to contain generic (void *) values and functions
 * to perform usual operations on lists.
 * All functions start with the prefix "list_", and (except for create) take a
 * pointer to a list as first argument.
 * 
 * There are higher-level functions to take care of the details:
 * - create (to create an empty list)
 * - add (at the end), add_first (at the beginning) and add_index (at the given
 *   index). add_index checks bounds and terminates the process in case the
 *   index is out of bounds.
 *   These functions return a pointer to the list, to make it possible to chain
 *   function calls.
 * - remove (at the end), remove_first (at the beginning) and remove_index (at
 *   the given index), the first two never fail (they leave the list unchanged
 *   and return NULL if the list is empty). remove_index checks bounds and
 *   terminates the process if the index is out of bounds.
 *   remove_element removes in the list the first element equal (as an
 *   address), if any, to the given element.
 *   If an element is removed, these functions return it (so that, for instance,
 *   it can be freed if need be).
 * - length, is_empty, get (with an index) and print (with a function argument)
 *   do not modify the list.
 *   The get function checks bounds and terminates the process in case the
 *   index is out of bounds.
 * - free, for which we can pass a free function pointer argument, if the (void
 *   *) elements need to be freed
 * - note that any failure of malloc in this library terminates the process
 *   with an error message
 *
 * Such lists can be used efficiently to implement generic
 * - stacks : push with add, pop with remove
 * - queues : enqueue with add, pop with remove_first
 * without ever needing to manipulate nodes.
 *
 * Accessing or inserting at first and last positions are O(1) operations.
 * get(i) has O(i) complexity
 *
 * The struct list and struct node types are not opaque, to allow to iterate
 * on lists with something like
 * struct list *l = list_create();
 * // then do things with l
 * struct node *curr = l->first;
 * for (; curr != NULL; curr = curr -> next) {
 *	do_something(curr);
 * }
 *
 * lower-level operations are given:
 * - insert_node_before, to insert a value before a given node in the list
 * - insert_node_after, to insert a value after a given node in the list
 * - remove_node, to remove a given node in the list
 * - create_node, to create a new node on the heap with a given (void *) element
 * The insertion after or before a given node and the removal operation of a given
 * node assume that the given node is part of the list. Behaviour is unspecified
 * if it is not.
 *
 * Any list manipulation using lower level operations, or by modifying the
 * members of the struct list (or struct nodes of this list) is on the sole
 * responsability of the user.
 *
 * The test file provides many examples.
